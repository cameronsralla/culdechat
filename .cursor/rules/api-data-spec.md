# Cul-de-Chat: API & Data Specifications
Last Updated: August 30, 2025

## 1. Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
A relational database like PostgreSQL is perfect for this. Hereâ€™s a logical breakdown of the tables we'll need for the MVP. We'll use a simplified notation here to show columns and relationships.

Assumptions:
- `id` is the primary key on entity tables
- `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps exist on all tables

### users
Stores information about each resident.

- `id` (uuid) - Primary Key
- `unit_number` (varchar) - The resident's unit number.
- `email` (varchar, unique) - Used for login and notifications.
- `hashed_password` (varchar) - The securely hashed password.
- `profile_picture_url` (varchar, nullable) - Link to their profile picture.
- `is_directory_opt_in` (boolean, default: false) - If true, their name/unit are public.
- `is_admin` (boolean, default: false) - Differentiates Business Admins.
- `status` (varchar, default: 'active') - Can be active, inactive (soft delete), pending.

### boards
Stores the user-created communities.

- `id` (uuid) - Primary Key
- `creator_id` (uuid) - Foreign Key to `users.id`
- `name` (varchar) - The name of the board (e.g., "Dog Lovers").
- `description` (text, nullable) - A short description of the board.

### posts
The individual threads started on a board.

- `id` (uuid) - Primary Key
- `author_id` (uuid) - Foreign Key to `users.id`
- `board_id` (uuid) - Foreign Key to `boards.id`
- `title` (varchar) - The title of the post.
- `content` (text) - The body of the post.
- `post_type` (varchar, default: 'standard') - Can be `standard` or `bulletin`.
- `is_pinned` (boolean, default: false) - For admin posts.

### comments
Replies to a specific post.

- `id` (uuid) - Primary Key
- `author_id` (uuid) - Foreign Key to `users.id`
- `post_id` (uuid) - Foreign Key to `posts.id`
- `content` (text) - The body of the comment.

### board_subscriptions (junction)
Tracks which users are subscribed to which boards.

- `user_id` (uuid) - Foreign Key to `users.id`
- `board_id` (uuid) - Foreign Key to `boards.id`
- Primary Key: composite (`user_id`, `board_id`)

### post_reactions (junction)
Tracks user reactions to posts.

- `user_id` (uuid) - Foreign Key to `users.id`
- `post_id` (uuid) - Foreign Key to `posts.id`
- `reaction_type` (varchar) - The emoji used (e.g., 'like', 'laugh').
- Primary Key: composite (`user_id`, `post_id`)
